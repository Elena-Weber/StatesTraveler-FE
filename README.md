Have you ever thought of visiting all the 50 states of the USA? I can help you!
States Traveler is a travel journal for a user fulfilling this dream. It contains all the 50 states in the alphabetical order and, as the user visits an interesting place in it (aka 'sight'), they can add it into their treasured collection. Each sight has a name of the place, a photo, your impression and state id (otherwise how would the app know where the sight is?). The user can create, read, update, delete, like and dislike the sights. The user can also display the list of all the sights or sights in a certain state. The user can also search for a certain sight to check whether the sight is present in their collection or in which state the sight is.
